Due to operating system limitations, the use of certain characters and filenames as instance names is forbidden!

## Windows

This is the most restrictive operating system in terms of file naming.

Your instance name cannot:

- Be an empty string
- Be longer than 255 characters
- End with a period (`.`)
- End with a space (` `)
- Contain any ASCII [control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character)
- Contain any of the following characters:
  - `<` (less than)
  - `>` (greater than)
  - `:` (colon)
  - `"` (double quote)
  - `/` (forward slash)
  - `\` (backslash)
  - `|` (pipe)
  - `?` (question mark)
  - `*` (asterisk)

Additionally, you cannot use any of the following reserved names:

- `CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`
- `COM1`, `COM2`, `COM3`, `COM4`, `COM5`, `COM6`, `COM7`, `COM8`, `COM9`
- `LPT1`, `LPT2`, `LPT3`, `LPT4`, `LPT5`, `LPT6`, `LPT7`, `LPT8`, `LPT9`

## macOS & Linux

These operating systems are more lenient in terms of file naming.

Your instance name cannot:

- Be an empty string
- Be longer than 255 characters
- Contain forward slashes (`/`)
- Contain [null characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_character)
