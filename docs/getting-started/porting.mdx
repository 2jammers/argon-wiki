Learn how to port your existing Roblox game to Argon!

## Porting from Roblox Studio

1. Create an empty Argon project as described in the [Create New Project](./new-project.mdx) guide
2. Make sure your `*.project.json` file has all services you would like to port included
3. Open target place in Roblox Studio
4. Change [Initial Sync Priority](../configuration.mdx#argon-plugin) to `Client` in Argon plugin settings
5. Go back to the project and start [Live Sync](./common-usage.mdx#live-sync)
6. Connect plugin to the running Argon session
7. Accept incoming changes from Roblox Studio (CLI only)
8. Voil√†! Your game is now on your file system and you can start coding!

## Instance Filtering

You can tell Argon to ignore certain instances by their **name**, **class** or **path**. Additionally you can specify **properties** that should be ignored. All of this can be done by specifying [Syncback Settings](/api/project#syncback-settings) in the `*.project.json` file. Here is an example:

```json
{
  "name": "Project",
  "tree": {
    "$path": "src"
  },
  "syncback": {
    "ignoreNames": ["Map", "Models"],
    "ignoreClasses": ["Part", "Camera"],
    "ignoreProperties": ["Size", "Position"]
  }
}
```
