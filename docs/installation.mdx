## Updating

Argon checks for updates and installs them automatically every time you run it. If there is a new version available you will be prompted for confirmation or just notified that the update got installed depending on the settings.

If you skipped custom client installation Roblox Studio plugin will update automatically as well!

You can force check for updates by running:

```bash
argon update
```

:::warning

- In order to make plugin update without restarting Roblox Studio you need to enable **Reload plugins on file changed** setting under File > Studio Settings > Directories
- Automatic updates are only available if you have installed Argon from GitHub or you are using the VS Code extension

:::

## Limitations

Argon has been designed and compiled for:

- Windows (x86 and ARM)
- macOS (x86 and ARM)
- Linux (x86)

Only 64-bit systems are supported!

:::info
There is no separate binary for Windows ARM but the x86 one works just fine thanks to the Windows' translation layer
